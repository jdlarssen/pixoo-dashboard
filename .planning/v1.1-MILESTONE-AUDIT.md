# Milestone Audit: v1.1 Documentation & Polish

## Overview

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Requirements | 18/18 satisfied |
| Phases | 2/2 complete |
| Integration | 3/3 connections wired |
| E2E Flows | 3/3 complete |
| Status | **tech_debt** |

## Requirements Cross-Reference (3-Source)

### Phase 7: Weather Color Fix (FARGE-01 through FARGE-03)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| FARGE-01 | ✓ Verified (code) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| FARGE-02 | ✓ Verified (code) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| FARGE-03 | ✓ Verified (tests pass) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

Phase 07 VERIFICATION status: `human_needed` — automated tests all pass (8/8 color-identity, 10/10 visibility), but physical hardware verification on Pixoo 64 LED display is deferred.

### Phase 8: Norwegian README (DOC-01 through DOC-15)

| REQ-ID | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| DOC-01 | PASS (lines 1-16) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-02 | PASS (lines 19-51) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-03 | PASS (lines 54-68) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-04 | PASS (lines 70-85) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-05 | PASS (lines 89-138) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

| DOC-11 | PASS (lines 304-321) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-12 | PASS (lines 325-350) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-13 | PASS (lines 354-366) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-14 | PASS (lines 370-393) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |
| DOC-15 | PASS (lines 396-408) | missing field | [x] Complete | **satisfied** |

Phase 08 VERIFICATION status: `PASS` — all 15 requirements verified with line-level evidence.

### Orphan Detection

No orphaned requirements. All 18 REQ-IDs in the traceability table appear in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md.

## Integration Check

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Connected exports | 3 |
| Orphaned exports | 0 |
| Missing connections | 0 |
| E2E flows complete | 3 |
| Broken flows | 0 |

### Key Integration Points

1. **COLOR_WEATHER_RAIN wiring** (FARGE-01): `layout.py:61` → `renderer.py:201` → `test_weather_anim.py:257` — production render path and regression test both import the live value.

2. **Phase 08 documents Phase 07 state** (DOC-12 ↔ FARGE-01/02): README weather animation section (lines 325-350) accurately describes the post-fix animation system including blue rain particles matching `weather_anim.py` code.

3. **Regression test suite** (FARGE-03): 8 TestColorIdentity tests + 10 TestAnimationVisibility tests pass. Phase 08 (README-only changes) did not affect any test files.

### E2E Flows Verified

1. **Rain animation renders with correct colors** — layout.py → renderer.py → weather_anim.py compositing chain intact
2. **Regression tests catch color clashes** — test imports live COLOR_WEATHER_RAIN, asserts contrast ratio ≥ 2.5
3. **User reads README and understands animation system** — DOC-12 content matches post-Phase-07 code state

## Tech Debt

### Phase 07: Weather Color Fix
- **Hardware UAT pending:** Physical Pixoo 64 verification deferred (rain readability at 2+ meters, all 8 animation types, color vibrancy)
- **SUMMARY frontmatter:** Missing `requirements-completed` field in 07-01 and 07-02

### Phase 08: Norwegian README
- **DOC-12 cosmetic omission:** Weather animation section doesn't document that rain text is specifically white (255,255,255) for contrast — the core FARGE-01 fix. Does not violate DOC-12 requirement scope.
- **SUMMARY frontmatter:** Missing `requirements-completed` field in 08-01 and 08-02

### Environment
- **Pre-existing:** 4 test files fail with `ModuleNotFoundError` for `dotenv` in bare Python 3.14 interpreter — not caused by v1.1 phases

## Conclusion

All 18 requirements satisfied. No critical gaps. No broken integration flows. All cross-phase wiring verified. Accumulated tech debt is non-blocking (hardware UAT deferred, minor documentation gaps, pre-existing environment issue).
