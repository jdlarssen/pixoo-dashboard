<objective>
Create the Norwegian README.md with the user-facing documentation sections: project overview with display photo placeholder, zone layout diagram, prerequisites, installation, configuration, usage, launchd setup, and "Bygget med Claude Code" badge with AI transparency section.

Purpose: Enable a developer finding the repo to understand, install, configure, and run Divoom Hub entirely from this README -- in Norwegian bokmaal.
Output: README.md with sections covering DOC-01 through DOC-08.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create README.md with overview, badge, photo placeholder, and zone diagram</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README.md in the project root written entirely in Norwegian bokmaal. Use a warm, personal tone -- this is a hobby project, not a corporate product.

**Top section structure:**
1. Project title ("Divoom Hub" or similar)
2. One-line description in Norwegian
3. "Bygget med Claude Code" shields.io badge. Use: `[![Bygget med Claude Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bygget_med-Claude_Code-orange?style=flat&logo=anthropic&logoColor=white)](https://claude.ai/code)` -- if the anthropic logo doesn't render, fall back to no logo. Test the badge URL renders correctly in markdown.
4. Display photo placeholder using markdown image syntax with descriptive Norwegian alt text: `![Pixoo 64-dashbordet i aksjon](docs/display-photo.jpg)` -- when the image file doesn't exist, GitHub renders the alt text cleanly as a placeholder. Add a small HTML comment near it explaining how to replace with a real photo.
5. Brief project overview (2-3 paragraphs) explaining: what it does (always-on LED dashboard), what it shows (clock, buses, weather), where it runs (Pixoo 64 on LAN), the personal context (home dashboard project)

**Zone layout diagram (DOC-02):**
- ASCII art showing the 64x64 display with all zones active and representative content (time "14:32", weather icon, Norwegian date "tor 20. feb", bus directions "<S 5 12 25" / ">L 3 8 18", temperature "7" with "2.3mm", high/low "5/2")
- Reference table with exact pixel coordinates from layout.py:
  | Sone | Y-start | Y-slutt | Hoyde | Innhold |
  | Klokke | 0 | 10 | 11px | HH:MM + vaerikon |
  | Dato | 11 | 18 | 8px | "tor 20. feb" |
  | Skillelinje | 19 | 19 | 1px | Teal-farge |
  | Buss | 20 | 38 | 19px | To retninger med nedtelling |
  | Skillelinje | 39 | 39 | 1px | Teal-farge |
  | Vaer | 40 | 63 | 24px | Temperatur, animasjon |

**Emoji usage:** Minimal. A few where they aid quick scanning (e.g., a bus icon for the bus section header), but mostly clean text headers per user decision.

**Language rules:**
- Strictly bokmaal (not nynorsk)
- Technical English terms acceptable when standard in Norwegian tech contexts (API, LED, LAN, daemon, etc.)
- Personal/informal register -- "du" form, not "De"
  </action>
  <verify>
- README.md exists in project root
- File starts with project title and badge
- Photo placeholder present with alt text
- ASCII zone diagram present with all 6 zones
- Reference table with pixel coordinates present
- All text is Norwegian bokmaal
- No real personal data (no real GPS coords except Oslo placeholder 59.9139/10.7522, no real tokens)

  <done>README.md has project overview, badge, photo placeholder, and zone layout diagram -- all in Norwegian bokmaal</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add prerequisites, installation, configuration, usage, launchd, and AI transparency sections</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Append the following sections to README.md (continuing the file from Task 1):

**Forutsetninger / Prerequisites (DOC-03):**
- Python 3.10+ (from pyproject.toml requires-python)
- Pixoo 64 on same LAN
- List main dependencies: pixoo, Pillow>=12.1.0, discord.py>=2.0, python-dotenv>=1.0

**Installasjon / Installation (DOC-04):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/divoom-hub.git
cd divoom-hub
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
```
Use placeholder GitHub URL (YOUR_USERNAME). Mention dev dependencies: `pip install ".[dev]"` for pytest and ruff.

**Konfigurasjon / Configuration (DOC-05):**
- Explain .env file pattern: copy .env.example to .env
- Document ALL variables from .env.example with required/optional flags:
  - REQUIRED: DIVOOM_IP, BUS_QUAY_DIR1, BUS_QUAY_DIR2, WEATHER_LAT, WEATHER_LON
  - OPTIONAL: ET_CLIENT_NAME, WEATHER_USER_AGENT, DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN, DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID, BIRTHDAY_DATES
- Use safe placeholder values (the Oslo coordinates 59.9139/10.7522 from .env.example are fine -- they're a well-known public location)
- Include links to Entur stoppested.entur.org for finding quay IDs and latlong.net for coordinates

**Bruk / Usage (DOC-06):**
- Normal mode: `python src/main.py`
- With custom IP: `python src/main.py --ip 192.168.1.100`
- Simulator mode: `python src/main.py --simulated` (no hardware needed, opens Tkinter window)
- Debug mode: `python src/main.py --save-frame` (saves each frame to debug_frame.png)
- Test weather: `TEST_WEATHER=rain python src/main.py --simulated` (test modes: clear, rain, snow, fog, cloudy, sun, thunder)

**Kjore som tjeneste / launchd Setup (DOC-07):**
- Step-by-step based on the actual comments in com.divoom-hub.dashboard.plist
- Include: edit paths, copy to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/, load, check status, stop, view logs
- Note the placeholder paths that must be edited

**AI-utvikling / AI Transparency (DOC-08):**
- Section explaining this project was built with Claude Code
- Personal, honest tone about the AI-assisted development process
- At Claude's discretion: level of detail, whether to include stats, framing
- The badge at the top links to this section or to claude.ai/code

**Section ordering and collapsible structure:** Use Claude's judgment for optimal reading flow. Consider using `<details>` for sections that are reference-heavy (like full .env documentation or launchd steps) to keep the main flow scannable.
  </action>
  <verify>
- README.md contains sections for: prerequisites, installation, configuration, usage, launchd, AI transparency
- .env variables match exactly what's in .env.example (DIVOOM_IP, BUS_QUAY_DIR1, etc.)
- Installation commands are correct (pip install ., not pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Usage commands match actual argparse in main.py (--ip, --simulated, --save-frame)
- launchd steps match comments in the actual plist file
- No real personal data in any examples
- All text in Norwegian bokmaal
  </verify>
  <done>README.md has complete user-facing documentation: prerequisites through AI transparency -- a developer can install and run from these instructions alone</done>
</task>

<success_criteria>
A developer who finds this repo on GitHub can:

2. See the zone layout diagram and understand the 64x64 display organization
3. Follow prerequisites -> installation -> configuration -> usage to get a working dashboard
4. Set up launchd for auto-start
5. Understand the AI development context from the badge and transparency section
All without needing any other documentation.
