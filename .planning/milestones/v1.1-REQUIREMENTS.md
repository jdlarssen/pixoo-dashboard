# Requirements: Divoom Hub

**Defined:** 2026-02-21
**Core Value:** Glance at the display and instantly know: what time it is, when the next buses leave, and what the weather is doing -- without pulling out your phone.

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for Documentation & Polish milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Dokumentasjon (README)

- [x] **DOC-04**: README has installation guide (clone, venv, pip install)
- [x] **DOC-05**: README has configuration guide (.env variables with required/optional flags)
- [x] **DOC-06**: README has usage section (running, --simulated, --save-frame)
- [x] **DOC-07**: README has launchd service setup (step-by-step)
- [x] **DOC-08**: README has "Bygget med Claude Code" badge and AI development transparency section
- [x] **DOC-09**: README has architecture overview (module map, data flow)
- [x] **DOC-10**: README has API documentation (Entur, MET Norway gotchas)
- [x] **DOC-11**: README has Discord message override section

- [x] **FARGE-03**: Color-identity regression tests prevent future color clashes

## Future Requirements

None -- v1.1 is a focused polish milestone.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| English README | Norwegian explicitly chosen for target audience; browser translation available |
| Nynorsk variant | User writes Bokmal; dual-language doubles maintenance |
| Auto-generated API docs (Sphinx/mkdocs) | Disproportionate to 2,321 LOC codebase |
| Configurable color picker | Over-engineering; 1-2 constant changes suffice |
| Per-weather-condition text colors | Adds complexity for minimal gain; use colors that contrast with all animations |
| Norwegian code comments | Convention is English for code; Norwegian for user-facing docs only |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
