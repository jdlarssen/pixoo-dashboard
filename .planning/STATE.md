## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: RLBL-01 (connection refresh) placed in Phase 1, not Phase 4, because research shows 300-push lockup hits after ~5 hours and must be prevented from day one
- [Roadmap]: 4 phases derived from natural delivery boundaries despite comprehensive depth setting; requirements cluster cleanly into foundation/bus/weather/polish without artificial splits

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 needs hands-on Norwegian bitmap font testing (research flagged -- candidates exist but none pre-confirmed at 5x7px with Latin Extended)
- Phase 2 requires Ladeveien quay ID lookup (5-minute mechanical task via stoppested.entur.org) before implementation
