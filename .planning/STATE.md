# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** Glance at the display and instantly know: what time it is, when the next buses leave, and what the weather is doing -- without pulling out your phone.
**Current focus:** Phase 8 - Norwegian README

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Documentation & Polish
Phase: 8 of 8 (Norwegian README)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: All plans complete, ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-02-21 — Completed 08-02 technical deep-dive sections

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4 (v1.1)
- Average duration: 1.5min
- Total execution time: 6min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 7. Weather Color Fix | 2/2 | 2min | 1min |
| 8. Norwegian README | 2/2 | 4min | 2min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 roadmap]: Color fix before README so documentation describes the corrected animation system
- [v1.1 roadmap]: Change RGB channels only; do not adjust alpha values (empirically tuned in v1.0)

### Pending Todos

1. Weather animation and rain text colors indistinguishable (display) — addressed by Phase 7

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
