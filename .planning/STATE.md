## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 roadmap]: Color fix before README so documentation describes the corrected animation system
- [v1.1 roadmap]: Change RGB channels only; do not adjust alpha values (empirically tuned in v1.0)

### Pending Todos

1. Weather animation and rain text colors indistinguishable (display) — addressed by Phase 7

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
